#  Phishing Simulation Project – IBM Internship | Nikhil Kumar

This project simulates a phishing attack to demonstrate how attackers steal credentials and how such threats can be mitigated. Conducted as part of an IBM internship and academic coursework, the simulation was executed using **Zphisher** on **Kali Linux**, with **LocalXpose** enabling external access. The aim is to raise awareness about phishing tactics and promote essential cybersecurity practices.

## Objectives

- Simulate a real-world phishing attack in a controlled environment.  
- Capture and analyze credential data.
- Identify vulnerabilities in user behavior.
- Propose effective countermeasures to prevent phishing.

## Tools & Technologies

- Kali Linux (VirtualBox Environment)  
- Zphisher  
- LocalXpose (for port forwarding)  
- Apache Server & Python  
- Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) – *Phase-1*  

##  Features

- Phishing site mimicking Instagram  
- Credential capture including IP address and browser details  
- Masked phishing link generation  
- Real-time simulation with screenshots  
- Security awareness and mitigation guidelines  

##  Key Learnings

- Ethical use of phishing tools in a safe simulation  
- The importance of HTTPS and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  
- How attackers exploit trust with spoofed interfaces  
- Identifying and avoiding social engineering tactics  

##  Future Scope

- Extend simulations to mobile environments and apps.  
- Develop a phishing awareness training module .
- Implement real-time phishing detection and alerting tools.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended **strictly for educational purposes**. No real users were harmed or targeted. Simulations were conducted in a controlled, ethical environment to demonstrate potential cyber threats and enhance awareness.

##  Project Structure

This structure reflects the phased development of the project, including visual evidence (screenshots), reports, and the complete documentation in a readable format.
