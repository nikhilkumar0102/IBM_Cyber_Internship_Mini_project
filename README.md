# 🔐 Phishing Simulation Project – IBM Internship | Nikhil Kumar

This project simulates a phishing attack to demonstrate how attackers steal credentials and how such threats can be mitigated. Conducted as part of an IBM internship and academic coursework, the simulation was executed using **Zphisher** on **Kali Linux**, with **LocalXpose** enabling external access. The aim is to raise awareness about phishing tactics and promote essential cybersecurity practices.
